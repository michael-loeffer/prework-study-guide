# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
A study guide for Coding Boot Camp course pre-work. This application was created to not only help Boot Camp students collect notes about important prework topics that they learned, but also to help them develop the associated skills by putting them to practice. As a student, I wanted a central repository of all the information covered in the prework so I could easily reference moving forward into the start of the Boot Camp. This study guide includes information about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. All of these topic areas were utilized to created this application and the exercise laid a great foundation for a coding career. 

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
The Prework Study Guide has a notes section for each of the main topics of the prework: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Additionally, if the DevTools console is opened (by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows) and then clicking on "Console"), you will see the Javascript code in action. You will see a list of topics learned during the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
