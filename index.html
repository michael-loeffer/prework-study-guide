        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage for the browser to read.</li>
          <li>The content of the title element is what shows up on the tab in your browser.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible contact shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Section elements are considered semantic elements as they help other developers easily navigate your code by creating organized blocks of code.</li>
          <li>The ul element stands for "unordered list" which creates a bulleted list of li elements (or "list items"). You are currently reading part of an unordered list right now!</li>
          <li>h1 to h6 elements represent different tiers and sizes of headers throughout your content</li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Inline CSS is added by including a "style" attribute to the opening tag of an HTML element, followed by a CSS rule</li>
          <li>Internal style sheets are achieved by adding a style element to the head section of an HTML file. This style element will contain the CSS rules for the webpage</li>
          <li>External style sheets are the preferred method of adding CSS to your webage. To do this, you need to include a link element in the head section of your HTML file, which links your CSS file to your HTML file.</li>
          <li>Link elements look like "link rel="stylesheet" href="file location""</li>
          <li>Composition of a CSS rule: selector {property: value;}</li>
          <li>CSS box model: content is surrounded by padding, which is surrounded by the border, which is surrounded by the margin</li>
          <li>* is the universal selector. Using an * applies the associated rules to every element on the page.</li>
          <li>.class-name is how you use a class attribute as a selector and to assign CSS rules to any element of your choosing, while not applying the rule to every single element of a given type (element selectors)</li>
        </ul>
