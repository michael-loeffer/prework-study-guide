        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage for the browser to read.</li>
          <li>The content of the title element is what shows up on the tab in your browser.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible contact shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Section elements are considered semantic elements as they help other developers easily navigate your code by creating organized blocks of code.</li>
          <li>The ul element stands for "unordered list" which creates a bulleted list of li elements (or "list items"). You are currently reading part of an unordered list right now!</li>
          <li>h1 to h6 elements represent different tiers and sizes of headers throughout your content</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Inline CSS is added by including a "style" attribute to the opening tag of an HTML element, followed by a CSS rule</li>
          <li>Internal style sheets are achieved by adding a style element to the head section of an HTML file. This style element will contain the CSS rules for the webpage</li>
          <li>External style sheets are the preferred method of adding CSS to your webage. To do this, you need to include a link element in the head section of your HTML file, which links your CSS file to your HTML file.</li>
          <li>Link elements look like "link rel="stylesheet" href="file location""</li>
          <li>Composition of a CSS rule: selector {property: value;}</li>
          <li>CSS box model: content is surrounded by padding, which is surrounded by the border, which is surrounded by the margin</li>
          <li>* is the universal selector. Using an * applies the associated rules to every element on the page.</li>
          <li>.class-name is how you use a class attribute as a selector and to assign CSS rules to any element of your choosing, while not applying the rule to every single element of a given type (element selectors)</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout branch-name: switches to another branch</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git branch -d branch-name: deletes a branch</li>
          <li>git restore unstaged-file-name: to discard any unstaged changes from working directory</li>
          <li>git add unstaged-file-name: adds the changed file in our working directory to the staging area of Git; stages your changes</li>
          <li>git add -A: adds ALL changed files in our working directory to the staging area</li>
          <li>git restore staged-file-name: to unstage staged changes before committing them</li>
          <li>git commit: commits staged changes to your repository</li>
          <li>git commit -m: commits staged changes to your repository, WITH an associated message briefly describing the changes implemented</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Var creates a new variable.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script; top to bottom.</li>
          <li>Console.log will output the value of a variable to the web console (accessed by ctrl+shift+i on a Chrome webpage).</li>
          <li>"script src="filename" /script" is how you link a .js file to your HTML file. Include this at the bottom of the body section</li>
          <li>=== is the strict equality operator. It checks to see if two values are equal and returns a Boolean result (true or false).</li>  
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.</li>
          <li>Values within an array can be called using their index. The index describes the location of a data item in an array.</li>
          <li>The first value in an array has an index of 0.</li>
          <li>variable++ will increment the value of the variable by 1 every time a loop is run (shorthand equivalent to variable+1).</li>
          <li>array.length will tell you the number of data points stored in an array.</li>
          <li>/*...*/ will "comment out" code that we don't want the browser to execute, but may want to save for later.</li>
          <li>"for (var x=0; x < shapes.length; x++) {code block}" is a good example of a "for loop".</li>
          <li>"function() {code block}" is the basic structure needed to create a function. Functions must be called after they are created in order to perform any of the code included within them.</li>
